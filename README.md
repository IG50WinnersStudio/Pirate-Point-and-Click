### Git-Rules
1. Do not work in main ( make sure current branch at the top of Git-Hub Desktop app is not main )
	- Do not commit to main
	- Do not branch from main ( Unless bug fixing )
	- Consider main a "release ready branch"
2. Create new branch for new feature ( from the branch "main", or the branch you're adding a feature )
	- Pull request to parent branch when done
3. Single responsibility commits - ( Commit single tasks/fixes )
	- Commit often ( Helps merging )
	- Try to keep adding files and changing files in seperate commits if possible
	- For commits = [ added feature, script and implemeted it ] < [added base] [wrote script 1] [implemented script 1 in base] [fixed script for base]
